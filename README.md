# Codename-Engine
A game engine for Pygame Projects. This is supposed to be a template for Pygame programs.

It will incorporate 
* music
* AI
* collision detection
* rendering backend

It is designed to be the most efficient and the most readable, as Pygame doesn't have many tutorials, yet alone for OOP.
